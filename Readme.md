[1] Import project via git (using "new project" wizard) or "Open Projects from File System".
Eclipse will create .settings/, .bin/ folders, .classpath, .project files.

[2] Download Slick2D library. You could create lib/ folder inside eclipse workspace folder and put Slick2D/ dir inside. The latter dir will contain unzipped slick library contents. Add Slick2D library to Eclipse project (Java Build Path), indicate the native library location of Slick to the folder Slick2D/, which contains unzipped Slick library contents.
